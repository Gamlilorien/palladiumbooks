# foundryvtt-palladiumbooks
This is unofficial Foundry VTT game system for playing Tabletop RPG titles from [Palladium Books®](https://palladiumbooks.com/) like: Rifts®, After the Bomb@reg;, Heroes Unlimited@trade; and more!

##Disclaimers
This project is NOT offically sanctioned by Palladium Books in any way, and therefore does not include anything but the bare bones framework needed for playing Palladium Books games in Foundry VTT. 

This is a work in progress provided to you as-is, with known bugs and limited functionality that is provided to you for FREE AND PERSONAL USE ONLY. Furthermore, this is my first attempt at Foundry VTT system development, which I am learning and developing soley in my spare time via trial and error. You are free to use, copy, or modify this work as you see fit as long as it used for non-commercial & personal use only and you honor Palladium Books Copyright, Trademark, and Internet Policies respectively (see below).

Please know that while I continue to learn and work on this project, future updates, espically ones that alter the underlying data model of the system, may cause breaking changes from previous versions. Therefore, please USE THIS CODE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I will obviously do what I can to avoid drastic updates or breaking changes, and make note of such changes if I can, but I also want to be 100% transparent as I don't know what I don't know!
